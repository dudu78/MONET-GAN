# MONET-GAN
GAN (Generative adversarial network) that generate monet's paintings
It take on input a dataset from my kaggle account https://www.kaggle.com/thomasduvergne/monet-to-numpy  of shape 128*128*3

here is the notebook that you can work with, activate the gpu first
the real problem is that the dataset is too small for the challenge 
dont hesitate to give me your feedback
